Gameplay

-If a guess is incorrect, hints will be provided to help narrow down the possibilities.

-Hints reveal whether the guessed agent shares the same nationality, gender, or role (Duelist, Sentinel, Controller, Initiator) as the correct agent.


Inspired by the hit word-guessing game Wordle, this game offers a similar experience but with a Valorant-themed twist.
